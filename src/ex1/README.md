In this assignment I built an undirectional weighted graph by data structures.
I used hashMap,Queue,List and Stack.
There is a private class named Edge-This class represents the distance between 2 nodes,
the distance is the weight of the edge between the 2 nodes.
The main data structure is hashMap that represents the nighbors for each node and second hashMap that represents
all the nodes in the graph.
There are 4 main classes in this assignment:
- WGraph_DS-represents an undirectional weighted graph (this class include the private class Edge and it methods).
- WGraph_Algo-represents an Undirected (positive) Weighted Graph Theory algorithms.
- WGraph_DSTest2- include tests for each method in WGraph_DS.
- WGraph_AlgoTest2- include tests for each method in WGraph_Algo.
